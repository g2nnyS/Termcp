// sshConfigImportFormat is the import/export file shape, stated identically in
// both ssh_config descriptions (the default listing and the write-enabled one,
// which RegisterSSHConfigWriteTools installs): they are two different strings
// built in two files, and a format spec duplicated by hand would drift the
// moment one of them is edited. Both variants reach the model in different
// deployments, and neither is privileged -- the default one is what a
// read-only instance shows, the other what an operator with
// --mcp-manage-ssh-configs shows -- so the spec has to be in both.
//
// It exists because the agent is often the one asked to *produce* the text (a
// user pastes in a list of hosts and wants it as an importable file), and the
// file format is not the tool's argument shape: a bastion is a nested table,
// while jump_host is an argument of this very tool. Writing the argument spelling
// into a file parses without error and silently drops the bastion, which is the
// failure worth documenting here rather than leaving to be discovered.
const sshConfigImportFormat = " IMPORT/EXPORT FORMAT (Web UI batch import; HTTP GET/POST /api/connections/batch): TOML, one [[connections]] table per profile with name (letters/digits/_/-, max 64) and kind=\"remote\", plus host, user, and password or private_key. Optional: port, key_passphrase, trust_unknown_host, known_hosts, dial_timeout_seconds, proxy, description, default_shell, default_mode, default_approval. A bastion is NESTED: [connections.jump] ([connections.jump.jump] for a deeper hop). The flat jump_host keys are arguments of this tool, NOT file fields -- a file using them parses cleanly and silently drops the bastion. Export emits this shape, so it re-imports unchanged; \"internal\" is reserved, an existing name becomes name-2, credentials are write-only."
