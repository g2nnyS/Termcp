// Package directive turns the single-entry `term` tool's `cmd` string into
// statements: which directive, which target, which flags, and — the part that
// must not be re-derived anywhere — the payload, taken as a SLICE OF THE SOURCE
// rather than re-assembled from parsed words.
//
// It parses with the real shell grammar (mvdan.cc/sh/v3/syntax) and never
// evaluates: `$HOME` in a payload is not expanded here, it is handed to the
// shell that will expand it. The rule that makes the whole format work is the
// one in the issue that produced this package: every word in `cmd` must be a word
// the shell itself can parse. `#` is a comment character, so a locator can never
// start with one — `run #a1f3:1 'x'` parses to just `run`, and that is reported
// as an error rather than silently fixed up.
//
// Two shapes exist, and the difference is a property of the directive:
//
//	payload  (run, alias):        everything after the target is raw bytes
//	flags    (key, read, file, …): --name[=value] after the target
//
// `pipe`/`pty` are payload directives whose `--argv` flag takes the REST of the
// statement: an argv is a word list (`--argv sh -c 'echo hi'`), and reading only
// the word after the flag would silently drop the program's arguments.
//
// Flags go AFTER the target, never before: `key --repeat 3 a1f3:1 up` is
// rejected, because a flag in second position breaks the one positional rule the
// whole syntax rests on ("word 2 is the target").

// watchDetail is the waiting rule, kept where a caller looks it up: the agent
// that held a terminal at a sudo prompt polled read in a loop because nothing
// told it waiting on a human is a supported move rather than a hang.
const watchDetail = `Register an async wake-up rule on a handle and stop polling; you are woken when
it fires. Events: output (any new bytes), exit (the process ended), silence (N
seconds with no output). Human at a prompt (sudo, password, a confirmation):
notify the human FIRST, then watch --event output on that handle — silence
fires on nobody speaking, which is the state you are already in while you wait.
One task's rule, not the handle's: watch --off <rule> when it is answered.
watch wakes the Agent; notify reaches the human.

--channel picks how the wake-up travels: resource (a resources/updated
notification, which any client can receive) or sampling (a createMessage the
client must have declared support for). Omit it and the server decides.
Defaults: --event output, --for 3 seconds (silence), --channel omitted = sampling
when the client declared it, resource otherwise.`

// spanDetail decodes the one-letter statuses, which are terse by design (they are
// written to log.jsonl for every status change) and unreadable without this.
const spanDetail = `Session output index: time, byte offset and line numbers per span, so a window
can be read by position instead of by streaming. status: o output (the shell's
own bytes), a AI input, i human input, q approval asked, A approved input. i/q
mean a person operated; a means the agent did. Read a span's bytes with
read <handle> --cursor <offset>, or its lines with --from-line <line>.`

// notifyDetail is the rule for reaching the human, stated where a caller looks it
// up. It used to be the notify_user tool's description; with one tool there is no
// per-operation description to hang it on, and the rule is exactly the kind of
// thing `help` exists for: needed at the moment of use, noise before it.
const notifyDetail = `Toasts + a system notification on every open Web UI page; --on highlights that
session's card. Call it BEFORE asking the human for anything — password, sudo,
MFA, passphrase, confirmation, approval, a choice, interactive input — and when
a long task ends or fails. Blocking asks: --level warn|error --sticky. Once you
have asked, WAIT: never poll, guess or fake an answer. A reply with no open page
was delivered to nobody, so say the ask in your own reply too. Defaults: --level
info; the toast lasts 10 seconds unless --sticky.`

// readDetail states the defaults because "read" without a selector is the
// common call: whether that means "new bytes" or "everything" decides what the
// caller does next, and guessing it from silence is how loops get written.
const readDetail = `Defaults: the new bytes since the last read on a live channel; a closed channel
returns its tail. --stream o keeps stdout only, e keeps stderr only; the default
keeps both. --cursor N is a byte offset (end+1 from Content-Range), --from-line N
a complete line, --tail N the last N lines.`

// closeDetail states the kill deadline, which otherwise looks instantaneous.
const closeDetail = `--force terminates a whole session; a channel closes with or without it. --grace N
is how many seconds a process gets to exit before it is killed. Default: 5.`

// argvDetail is the --argv contract: a word list, not a command line. It is
// stated on `help pipe` because both failure modes are silent or come from the
// wrong layer: a dropped argument looks like the program ignoring input, and a
// shell operator in the value would be handed to the program as text.
const argvDetail = `--argv is a word list (argv), not a shell command line. Words are split with the
shell's quoting rules, but nothing is expanded: quote an argument that contains
spaces, e.g. pipe internal --argv sh -c 'echo hi'. Shell operators are not
interpreted — for 'cd /srv && make' pass a script: --argv sh -c 'cd /srv && make'.
Put --argv LAST: every word after it belongs to the program, so --name, --on-exit
and --size must come before it. Write it as you would in a terminal: wrapping the
whole argv in one pair of quotes makes it ONE program name
(--argv 'go build ./...' runs a program with spaces in its name). --on-exit
defaults to keep: the session survives its last shell; --on-exit close ends a
one-shot session with it.`

// profileFileFormat is the import/export file shape (Web UI batch import; HTTP
// GET/POST /api/connections/batch). It is stated here, once, because the agent is
// often the one asked to *produce* that text — a user pastes a list of hosts and
// wants an importable file — and a format spec duplicated in prose would drift
// from the parser the moment either is edited.
const profileFileFormat = `profile file format (the batch import/export shape):

  [[connections]]
  name = "prod"                 # letters/digits/_/- , max 64
  kind = "remote"
  host = "10.0.0.5"

  password = "…"                # or private_key = "…"
  # optional: port, key_passphrase, trust_unknown_host, known_hosts,
  #           dial_timeout_seconds, proxy, description,
  #           default_shell, default_mode, default_approval

A bastion is NESTED — [connections.jump], and [connections.jump.jump] for a
deeper hop. The flat --jump-host style flags of this directive are NOT file
fields: a file using them parses cleanly and silently drops the bastion.
Export emits this shape, so it re-imports unchanged. "internal" is reserved,
an existing name becomes name-2, and credentials are write-only.`
